- Pieter Levels: Programming, Viral AI Startups, and Digital Nomad Life | Lex Fridman Podcast #440
- Save 3h43m33s

- Pieter Levels, @levelsio on X
- self-taught developer & entrepreneur
- designed, programs, shipped and ran over 40 startups
  many of which are hugely succesful
  in most cases, he did it all by himself
  while living the digital nomad life, in over 40 countries & 150 cities
- programming on a laptop, on a couch
- use HTML, jQuery, PHP and SQLite
- lived in Holland
- graduated university (in Holland)
- studied in Korea in 2009

- (00:02:08) tweet
  "Only 4 out of 70+ projects I ever did made money and grew"

- make everything himself
  don't raise money
  developer, designer,
  make the logo
- much more scrappy
- because no funding, need to go fast to see if an idea works
- got an idea
  build a micro, mini startup
  launch within two weeks or so,
  check if people actually sign up & pay money
  if they pay, the idea is validated
- most ideas don't work

- being alone allows him to be fast
  which is an advantage compared to big companies

- About the gym
  - overhead press (shoulder press), feels good, it's like you win
  - it acts like therapy for him
  - something about "hard work", physical work, that makes you feel better

- building is about having fun
  - he was doing it when he didn't make money
  - he was making electronic music, drum, bass music 20 years ago
  - fun to have a daily challenge, try to figure stuff out
  - doing something creative is fun

- build a lot of things
  but never scale it, and made it big
  => not something he controls,
     but doesn't want the stress that comes with it
  - he has friends who built companies with VC fundings
    and they don't like it, they don't want to become CEOs or managers


LOW POINT:
- graduated from univeristy in Holland
  didn't want to get a normal job
  because couldn't hangout with his friends on the week
- was making money with youtube
  he had this music career & was uploading music on youtube
  getting money from AdSense
  $2k, $3k
- didn't see himself live in holland
  at 27, left and went to Asia (thailand)
  started digital nomading, did that for a year
  but that made him feel worse, he was alone in hotel rooms.
  Questing his life, while his friends were doing really well with normal jobs
- felt like an outcast
- money was shrinking
  was making $500 a month
- "I am 27, I'm a loser", that's when he started building startups
- his dad told him, "if you are depressed, you gotta take a shovel, start doing
something, can't stay still"
- about feeling like a loser
  - it's normal if you are young to feel like a loser
- travel can make you insane,
  it can be very psychologically taxing
  he knows digital nomads that killed themselves
  - you are a stranger
  - you don't have home
  - you're constantly moving around
  - some digital nomads were doing shady stuff (like selling drugs)
  - felt like an outcast, even among other nomads
- went back to holland
  got even more depressed


- started "12 startups in 12 months"
  - every month, would launch a project, with stripe
  - basic format:
    - try to build a thing
    - put it online
    - put a Stripe checkout button
  - at that point he could code a little bit
    - when he was doing youtube
      he made a website for the youtube channel "Panda Mix Show"
    - his CD album was using Flash
      - ActionScript (Flash's javascript equivalent)
      - Lex wasted a lot of hours learning Flash
      - Steve Jobs killed it, "Flash sucks, stop using it"
  - he had to learn to code, & basic stuff
    but didn't have much time, because he needed to launch 1 project per month
  - published it as a blog post, to be accountable
  - first project: "Play my inbox"
      2013, him & his friends would send music to each other (youtube links)
      by email, they had giant email threads on gmail
      the app would long into Gmail, get the emails and find the ones with
      YouTube links and then make a gallery of the songs
      - this got a bit of press attention
      - free, no pay button
      - 10,OOOs of people using it
      - hard to make money with extensions, plugins
        people expect these to be free
        - extensions should be extension of your startup, your original product
  - the hard part is to figure out what you shouldn't build
    what feature you shouldn't build
    because you don't have the time

  -
  - need to build a landing page
  - need to build the product
  - do you need to build a login system?
    maybe no, for photoAI, you sign up, you pay for Stripe you get a login link
    with a hash, not very safe but did that for a year, now he has google login
  - keeping it very scrappy is very important to be fast

  - so
    - product
    - landing page
    - stripe checkout
    - scrappy login with login link
  - how are people gonna find it?
    - put it on reddit? how do you do to not look like a spammer?
      maybe find a subreddit that could be interested

- when he was 9 yo, he was making websites
  tried to open a merchant account
  - before Stripe, there was "worldpay", you had to fill out forms, had to fax
    them to America
  - nobody paid for anything


- digital nomad
  - Asia is cheap, Chiang Mai (thailand), rent for $150/month
  - work remotely with laptop on your business
  - very adventurous life
  - travel around, build your business
  - no pressure from your home country/society (get a job, a house, a wife & kids)
  - feel free
    nobody telling you what to do
    (Lex: Franz Kafka said "I am free and that is why I am lost.")
    - but feel like an outcast
      free but can't relate to anything or anyone
    - you think being free would make you happy
      but actually he thinks constraints probably make you happy
  - go from city to city
    see a lot of cool things
  - common thing: people would wake up & forget where they are
  - didn't make him happy, made him anxious
- nomalist.com
  a community of 3k digital nomads
  built it because he was feeling lonely
  organized meetups, made friends


- favorite place: Bangkok & Chiang Mai, Thailand is very special
  - thailand wins in how nice people are
    how easy of a life people have there
    but air quality sucks & quite hot

- happy memories
  - in Bali, wake up at 6PM
    drive to the coworking space on a motorbike
    buy 30 hot lattes from a cafe (for like 6 people)
    work all night (because coworking space was silent), locked in
    play techno music
    when sun would go up (6am) the yoga people would come in
    they would go home, sleep in a hostel or hotel

- drum & bass, industrial techno, fast pace is good for coding
  makes you want to lock in & get things done


- book "make, bootstrapper's handbook"
  - how to find ideas?
    - spot problems
      find something in your daily life that doesn't work well
    - make a list of these problems
      (he used trello, now he uses telegram)
      if you can find a viable solution & build it
    - to come up with interesting ideas
      you gotta try to live a more interesting life
    - travelinig helps you discover new things
    - used to have a list of ideas
      statistically the more you have & try, the higher the probability that one
      will work
    - now that he has money, he can do more things based on technology
      ex of AI, exploring possibilities & trying things, not based on existing
      problems
  - choose idea that is the most viable to build
  - build
    - build with the tech that you know
    - use the simplest things, you can use google sheet to start your business
      (ex of nomadlist)
    - the tech is not important when you start a business
      what's important is to validate the idea, that there's a market, a product
      that people want to pay for

- photoai.com
  - fire your photographer
    you don't need a photographer anymore
  - you can train yourself as an AI model
    you can generate picture of you in any place, clothes, facial expression
  - use replicate for the compute
    https://replicate.com
  - tried to figure out how to do photo realistic AI photos
    - stabe diffusion by itself was not doing that well by itself
    - started to find these fine-tuned models that did better.
      these models were trained with c*rn
    - so need to remove it,
      need to prompt out the NSFW content
    - he has google vision to check every picture for NSFW
  - PHP, jQuery, SQLite
    - people are getting sick of JS frameworks
  - story about this:
    - beginning of stable diffusion
    - somebody forked it & made it work for macbooks
    - downloaded it, clonede the repo
      started using it to generate images
      write a prompt & it generates an image
      - it was bad at people
      - but it was good at making houses, architecture
    - made thishousedoesnotexist.org
    - pivoted to interiorai.com
      generate interior design
      - then new tech called image to image
        input an image and modify it
      - take a photo of your house interior
        & prompt it to change the design (ex: maximalist design)
      - launch it & made 10k, 20k a month
        it still makes $40/50k a month
      - then fine tuned the model
        with interior design images
    - learned fine tuning
      get existing (pre-trained) model, and train it on specific goal
    - then for fun, fine tuned a model using pictures of himself
      and it worked
      and you could prompt image to modify it to fit a certain style
    - that gave birth to avatarai.me
      went viral made like $100k in a week,
      (big VC companies like Lenze built an iOS app that does the same, made like $30 mil)
      but it was cheezy, it was hype, let's focus on a real problem
    - this became photoai.com
  - making photoai better:
    lot of people using it, a million/month of images generated
    he would set random values to parameters to see what works best
    (users select/download the best ones, and use this info to take the best
    parameters)
  - most people are still on Stable Diffusion 1.5, because it's better than
  newer version (1:16:17)

- avatarai.me
  - shared the process on twitter
  - used 7 photos of himself (at the very beginning) to train the model
  - started generating photos of himself & sharing them on twitter
  - receiving DMs of people wanting to do the same
  - so he made an HTML page
    with a Stripe payment link
    they would get a link to a Typeform to upload their photos (after paying)
    but he didn't code anything to automate it, so he was doing it manually
    for the few 100 customers, he literally took their photos, train them,
    then generate the photos with the prompts and send the generated images by
    email.
  - made $100k in 10 days
  - validated very quickly, but was hype and died very quickly
  - people would uplaod full body picture
    so he would crop the face, but lose body appearance
    (now he used face & body pictures)

  - he uses platforms to fine-tune models
    the vendor increased price from $3 to $20 when they realized he was making
    that much money
    - so started talking to other ML platforms
      replicate was one of those platform
      he DM the CEO: "can you please create this fine tuning thing"
      CEO said "no, it takes too long to run, we don't have the GPUs for it"
      after a week he accepted, and they launched it

  - data is the most important
    - photos should be diverse, should have different closes, different environment
    - you want the AI model to train/recognize the thing that is always the same
    

- his tech stack: HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP & SQLite
  - that the thing he knows
    and what he was using when his startup took off
  - put "learn Node.js in his to-do list"
    but didn't have the time to learn it
    - "one time I'll start coding properly" but never got time to do it
  - can get more stuff done if you don't care how you do it
  - now there are frameworks that raise a lot of money (millions of $)
    and promote it to young developers, so they use these frameworks and the
    platform that comes with it.
    So you should use the pricy platform (*cough* vercel *cough*)
    which is 10x the price of hosting it on a server or VPS
    - they pay dev influencers to promote this stuff
  - people ask him why he doesn't use "X" technology, why not use this new tech,
    new frameworks
    => because PHP just works
       he don't really optimize anything
  - he's suspicious about money in these frameworks

- focus on what matters
  - gear acquisition syndrome

- you need to join X (twitter)
  the whole AI industry is on X
  anime pfp chads
  - can learn a lot

- life is like surfing, you are getting carried away in some direction
  - can't control everything

- hoodmaps
! (1:29:57)
  - documented the whole process with blogpost & video
  - app, like google maps, put colors over areas
  - blue = offices
    green = rich
    yellow = hip
    red = tourists
    dark blue = Uni
    grey = normies
    ...
  - google maps iframe
    on top of it 50% opacity HTML canvas
    then draw colors on top of it
  - crowdsource the thing to color the maps
    people would color with different colors
    then a cron job would pick the color with the "most votes"
  - in 1 week enough data
  - most data in Los Angeles
  - tagging: to write something on a specific location
    (like don't go there)
    can upvote or downvote
!   (1:35:18)
  - went viral
    ran out of google maps credit
    switched to mapbox and got a bill of $20k
    switched to open source
  - made $0
    couldn't monetize it
    but some things should just exist, it's cool that hoodmaps exists
    (ads? but where do you put ads)
  - front page of reddit
    - server went down

- nomadlist
! (1:42:12)
  - list of best cities to live & work as digital nomads
  - started as a public google spreadsheet anyone could edit
    (crowdsourced, people adding information)
  - turned it into a website
  - started when he was in Chiang Mai (Thailand)
  - collection of information about a city
    rent, internet speed, weather, healthcare, nightlife, happiness, income level,
    education, power grid, safety...
  - started with crowdsource
    then realized he can download data from accurate public dataset
    (like WorldBank, United Nations)
  - members can add where they are or their travels
    you can click on a city & see the people who are there, who will be there,
    or who were there
!   (1:44:38)
  - 30 to 45k members
  - members organize meetups (by themselves)

- lex also built a public spreadsheet for working out
  and there was little trolls
  people would delete the trolls, like a sort of immune system


- how do you learn quickly & effectively
  - 30-day session to learn 3D
  - taking action is the best way to learn
  - making things, you know nothing, you google stuff or ask chatGPT and you
    learn like that
  - build, build, build
    faster than reading books or tutorials
  - be consistent, don't quit, keep doing it
  - go one problem at the time
    how to build this, search, learn, do it, then next thing, then next thing,
    then why does this not work...

- girl who did 160 websites in like 160 days or something

- build in public
  - power of crowdsourcing
  - haters are actually good
    - haters have good points
      ("your website because [actual pain point]")
    - need to grow a very thick skin (on twitter, x)
    - muted 15k people (in 10 years)
      doesn't block, because people are annoying

  - Today, TikTok, YouTube shorts, Instagram reels is the way to market your product
    - got $20k extra per month from one TikTok video (for photoai)
      made by some random guy
    - some influencers make videos on app or product
      and then they go ask the builder and say "I can do it again for like $4k"
    - TikTok is a big platform for user acquisition
      it's organic
    - you don't need a lot of followers anymore to go viral
      (on X, TikTok, instagram)
      - they test your content on a small subset, like 300 people
        if they like it, it will be tested on 1k, and on and on

- getting paid
  - lot of people try freemium
    - never worked for him
    - generally free users don't convert (to paid)
    - if you have VC funding, it makes sense, because you can have a lot of people
    coming with ads, and give free trials
    - converting free to paid users is very difficult
  - it's best to start asking for money right away
    - show you app,
      show what you are doing on the landing page
      make a demo, a video or whatever
    - if you want to use it, pay money
    - ask more than $10 a month
      (Netflix is $10/month, but Netflix is a big company that can afford to
      make it relatively cheap)
      - when you are an indie hacker, you need to make at least $30 per user
        to be able to survive
    - it builds a community of people who care about the product
      - common to make a discord
        very normal to have the devs & users in a discord server
      - high quality users
        - free users are horrible
          millions of people
          abusing your app, hacking
          complaining, high expectations
      - prevent bots & spammers
  - make margin very high
    - keep costs very low (he doesn't hire anyone)
    - try to negotiate with AI vendors now
      - you can just email people and ask for a discount
        a lot of them would say yes, like 25%, 50%
      - being a "public" person can help
        (that's why you should shit post on twitter, to get discounts)

- 4chan
  - "The antisocial network" on netflix, about 4chan
  - anti-system for fun
  - you'r having fun, you're anti-system
    but the nazis always show up
    it start drifting
      - bad shit happens
        like school shooting
  - 2010 Levels would go on 4chan for fun
    they would post crazy offensive stuff just to scare off people (normie filter)
  - it was always about provoking
  - 4chan discovered hoodmaps
    would write some nasty shit
    he added a NSFW word list


- how do you fight spam?
  - use GPT-4
    -people can post reviews
    -he asks GPT-4 if they are good reviews, is it offensive, is it racist...
    -it sends him messages on telegram when it rejects reviews so he can manually
    check
  - he has GPT-4 on the chatting community to moderate it
    it's good, it understands humor, double senses...
  - uses GPT4 for fact check



- automation
  - once you have a thing, you built it, it starts making money
    automate it
  - once you start making money, you can start hiring people
    but he felt like he doesn't have the money for that,
    he doesn't want to manage people/a big company
  - try to automate as much as possible
    everything that can be automate, why have someone do it
  - now with AI, you can automate so much more stuff than before
  - lot of cron jobs
    - he logs into the server
      sudo crontab -e
      and makes php scripts execute hourly "php do_something.php"
  - healthchecks
    - webpages have healthchecks (with ✅ & ❌ emojis)
      to test: internet speed, # of signups, database connection...
    - uptimerobot.com
      can check keywords, so it checks for ❌ (the red X emoji)
      so it opens the healthcheck webpage every minute to check if something's bad
    - if it's bad it sends him a message on Telegram
  - all php & javascript errors are sent to his telegram

- social media
  - doesn't use tiktok anymore, feels dumb
  - mute board list
    mute politics
  - you need to "mod" your app to get good content
    & not be toxic for your mental health

- never sold a company
  - been in a lot of acquisition negotations
    - lot of people string you on to acquire you
      it takes 6/12 months, then want to see everything, stripe, code...
      then they will change the initial price to lower
    - companies are usually sold as a multiple of the revenue or profit (3-5x)
    - for him, everything is automated, he can just wait a few year to make that
      money, it doens't make sense to sell

- working solo
  - not good at working with other people
  - don't trust people
    - trust some people, his bestfriend Andre,
    - hired a guy to code the AI in python for photoAI
  - don't want to have consensus meeting, "compromise results"
    - end up with average ideas, average company, average culture
  - never coded with someone else

  - solo vs big companies
    - lex fridman about MLA (multi-language audio) team at youtube (you can have
    multiple audio for the same video for different language)
    everything needs to be approved, slow,...
    - legal team
    - (lex) needs a powerful/dictatorial leader
      ignore lawyers, ignore PR, ignore everybody, give power to the engineers
      listen to people on  the ground, get shit done

- can't code ruby, python
  doesn't know react, nodeJS

- he's making a new AI startup with his bestfriend
  Andre codes,
2:17:52

- lex frid: I like working with people where when I approach them I pretend in
my head that they are the smartest person who has ever existed. Then look at
what they build, code (or whatever), and try to see the genius of their way.
You really have to understand people, understand how they think
  - code empathy

- most people are very average at their job
  especially with coding

- push to production
  modifies something -> cmd+enter -> automatically commit + push + deploy to prod
  - doesn't have a test env
  - can fix bug really fast

- bugs are a good things, it shows that the team is building

- use VScode
- says he doesn't have the time to learn new tech
  he probably should, he wants to learn things like react & next, but he prefers
  to work on the businesses, or learn about AI
  - maybe it could be good to learn new things
    see what works best
  - there's no "common"/"standard" way to build web app
    it's hard to tell what's the best way to things
- use macbooks since 2014
  switched from windows, with 3 screens, set up for music prod...
    - the finder is horrible

- favorite place to work: the couch
  16" macbook, no external screen

- go to sleep at 2AM, before 4AM, his gf goes to sleep at midnight
  wake up at 10/11am, shower, make coffee
  chill a bit with gf
  then open laptop, start coding
    (used to code for long hours, but trained to have more interruptions, can
    lock in & lock out very fast now)
  cook, have lunch, or go out

- listen to techno
  listen to HÖR Berlin

- coworking space
  - 45min slots where not allowed to speak or you give $1 per word

- remoteOK: a job board for remote jobs
  job posts start at $299
  at the peak 2021, making $140k/month, then went to $10k, now back to $40k
  adding crazy upsells: like rainbow color, background images ($1k)
  -> job post would cold $3 or $4k


3:07:07

people around you, people you lvoe, nice food, nice experiences, meaningful work, exercise

- wrote a blog post about "why I'm unreachable and maybe you should be too"
  - getting lot of DMs
    people were angry that he wasn't responding
    so he closed his DM
    so explain why he closed 

- advice to young people
  - listen to nobody, do what you think is good & follow your heart
  - everybody peer pressures you into doing stuff you don't want to do
  - try your own thing
    there's space in the economy for you to do your own thing
  - gotta go all out
