neural link is a generalized input/output device
reading & generating electrical signals

everything you lived is electrical signals
brain is biological computer

probabilistic restoration of memories

neuralink may help with AI safety

what would inhibit alignment of human with AI?
low data rate of human

increasing number of electrodes, channels
multiple neuralink implants

believe there's a future with 100s of mil of people with neuralink

could upload your memories, so you never lose memories

when can I get neuralink? probably less than 10 years

1 or 2 years, someone with neuralink could beat a pro-gamer, because of faster reaction time

lex visited memphis (elon's data/compute cluster center)
To win AI, you've got to have the most powerful training compute
memphis cluster isn't working yet!
power fluctuation issues, because of synchronize training
finally got some training going
elon tries to do whatever people at the frontline are doing to understand it (connecting fiber cables, checking faulty wires)
RDMA, remote direct memory access
it's like one big brain, any gpu can talk to any other gpu
100k gpu, crazy amount of cables

grock 3 available at the end of the year, if they are lucky, should be next level
grok (xAI) has advantage of having immediate access to twitter data
tesla real-time video data (several million cars)
optimus robot (100s of mil of robots) could be the biggest source of data
humans have accumulate little data about reality,
we run out of data pretty quickly
the internet is now polluted with a lot of AI content

xAI could be the first to get AGI? Elon unsure: um it's possible
define AGI: Lex: we will never acknowledge that we built agi
AGI when it's smarter than collective intelligence of the entire human specy
if xAI is first, the others won't be far behind,
how do you do it in way that doesn't hurt humanity?
if you train AI to lie, you're really asking for trouble,
if you enforce rules, they could backfire
getting the truth is difficult, but aspiring to be truthful is better
for grok they use AI to check if it's most likely correct or not before using it

optimus
could be as many cars (2 billions), elon is confident there will be billions of robots (almost certainty)
still struggle to have it to walk in the park
can already pick up objects
hand: close to half of all the engineering
still a lot of work to do
(spent some talking about hands)

what it takes for a great engineering team
intense drive towards simplifying the process
understanding the process, improving it, iterating it

basic first principle algorithm:
1) question the requirements, make them less dumb, reduce the number
make the question the least wrong as possible
2) delete the steps where the process stops.
(delete things, even if you need to put them back in after you realize you need them)
3) optimize it/simplify the process

mistake of smart engineers = optimize things that should not exist

Donald Trump endorsement
(elon implies he doesn't agree with everything DT said/done)
trump displayed courage under fire, you can't faint bravery
elon is glazing (strong, courageous)
comparing biden vs trump, easy choice
we don't have a secure border
we want clean & safe city
reduce/slow down spending, currently bankrupting the country
US is spending more in gross interest on treasury dept securities than it does on national defence (argentina analogy)
He discussed wtih Trump the idea of a government efficiency commission, he would be willing to be part of, to remove/delete the inefficient things (attacking the matrix at that point, the matrix will fight back)

book recommendation: "The lessons of History" by Will & Ariel Durant
civilization is about 5k years starting with the sumarians
eath is 4.5B years
many rise & fall of empires, we are not safe
civilization goes in cycles, no civilization is forever
as soon as civilization reaches a level of prosperity, the birth rate declines
(happening right now, happened with roman empire)
too many laws can be problematic, need a garbage collection for laws

dealing with personal attacks:
"it does get me down at times" "makes me sad"
attacks are done by people who don't know him, try to generate clicks
detach yourself emotionally

measure of success in life = how many useful things I can get done, maximizing utility
time is the true currency
slightly better decisions can have 100s Mil $ for spaceX, telsa
so more time = better decision = more money

curiosity, trying to understand
goal is to understand the universe, or at least help to get there
one is to make our civilization last as long as possible (if we didn't get visited by aliens maybe it's because they were unable to survive long enough)

spaceX goal is to establish a self-sustaining city on Mars

// PART 2 DJ Seo

- DJ Seo, co-founder, president, COO of Neuralink.
- studied electrical engineering during undergrad
started out his research in MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) to build this
tiny structure for temperature sensing. Spent his majority of his college years
building millimeter wave circuits for next gen telecommunication systems, for
imaging.
- PhD program at UC Berkeley, at the Berkeley Wireless Research Center looking at
building "XG" the next generation telecom (like 3G, 4G, 5G)
- during grad school, pursue whatever project he wanted
  worked on "smart bandaid", there were hypotheses that when you apply external
  electric field to a wound, you can accelerate the closing of the wound, in
  collaboration with Pr Michel Maharbiz (known for remote control of beetles)

interested in understanding the purpose of things
building tech to understand the brain, not until graduate school
fascinated by building physical stuff
- key events that lead him to do what he's doing now:
  - growing up, both sides of his family, grandparents had very severe form of Alzheimer
  - when he was a teenager, came to the US, didn't speak a word of english, lot
  of struggle to connect with other people, so spent a lot of time alone, reading sci-fi books,
  especially the "Ender's Game" saga by Orson Scott Card (visual @ 1:31:50) &
  Neuromancer by William Gibson, and Snow crash by Neal Stephenson, and movies
  like the matrix, influenced him on the impact that tech can have on our lives
- brain is incredible fragile but also incredibly plastic & resilient

- 2013, holy grail of implantable systems is to understand how small of a thing
you can make (a lot of that is driven by how much energy/power you can supply
to it & how you extract data from it)
At that time at Berkely there was this desire to understand, in the neural space,
what kind of system you build to really miniaturize these implantable systems.
Michel: "I think I have a solution", the solution is ultrasound, then whe proceeded
to kind of walk through why that is the case, that formed the basis for his thesis
work called "neural dust".
- "neural dust": tiny, wireless sensors designed to be implanted in the body to
monitor and interact with nerves, muscles or organs. Powered & communicate using
ultrasound.

- said the word "kind" a lot (lol)

- the body is mostly salt water at 37 degrees Celsius, which is an extremely
harsh environment for any electronics to survive
- electromagnetic waves don't penetrate through this env well, and because of
the wave length the devices needs to be quite big
- general good rule of thumb is that you want the wavefront to be roughly on
the order of the size of the thing you're interfacing with.
so implant that is 10 to 100 micron -> would have to operate at hundreds of GigaHertz,
which is hard to build & the body attenuates that very significantly
- ultrasound travels a lot more effectively in the human body tissue compared
to electromagnetic waves, because ultrasound waves are compressive which is a
completly different mode of wavefront propagation
- ultrasound to power the device & getting data back
- how to get the data back? backscattering
- backscattering is a phenomenon in which particles or waves are scattered back
in the direction from which they came after interacting with a material.
  - used with RFID cards (Radio Frequency ID tag) (ex on credit cards), no battery
  inside, there's an antenna and some sort of coil with serial ID
  the reader sends a wavefront, it reflect back that wavefront with some sort
  of modulation that's unique to your ID.
  - we can use piezoelectric crystal to convert ultrasound to electricity & vice versa.
- history of BCI (brain computer interface)
  - 1790s: concept of animal electricity discovered by Luigi Galvani
    connected set of electrodes to frog leg
  - 1920s, Hans Berger discovered EEG & electroencephalography
  - 1940s, Renshaw, Forbes, Morrison inserted glass micro electrodes into the
  cortex and recorded single neurons.
  - 1950s, Hodgkin & Huxley build the model of biological neurons that describes
  the action potentials of a neuronal biological membrane
  - 1969, Eb Fetz (Univ of Washington) published paper "Operating Conditioning
  of Cortical Unit Activity", he was able to record a single unit neuron from a
  monkey & was able to have the monkey modulated based on its activity & reward system
  - 1980s paper by Apostolos Georgopoulos, discovered "motor directional tuning curve",
  single neurons in the motor cortex exhibit maximal activity for a particular
  "preferred" movement direction.
- he's interesting about taping into the high res, high fidelity of the signals

- brain is mad out of billions of neurons, interconnected in a network constantly
changing, bathed in this charged environment (potassium, sodium, clorine ions)
Neurons have a membrane with a protein structure called the voltage-gated selective ion channels
- when we put an electrode next to a neuron we're trying to captures these local
changes in the potential, mediated by the movements of the ions.
- 2 dominant physics domain: diffusion physics (farther from src)
& electromagnetism (close to src), which one dominates depends where the electrode is
when you are close, you get the typical spike, once you are further away (100 micron)
you no longer hear from that neuron (can't record that local change of the membrane)
- 100x100micron contains roughly 40 neurons
- you want to listen to the neurons & let the software do the job of decoding
- most neurons are usually very quiet

- how does neuralink work?
neural link implant in january in the first human (Noland)
  - 3 major components (image at 2:16:47 https://youtu.be/Kbk9BiPhm7o?si=aPd3-q23Z47Oo4k8&t=8207)
    - N1 implant or "the link": the device that records these neural chatters
    - R1, surgical robot that implants the tiny wires (threads)
    - B1 app: software to decode the signals, running very simple ML model that
    enable the first user Noland to move a cursor
  - done wirelessly
  - the implant is a two-part: "the link" has these flexible threads that have
  multiple electrodes along its length, they're only inserted into the cortical
  layer (3 to 5 mm in the human brain) in the motor cortex region
  64 of these threads, each with 16 electrodes along the span of 3 or 4 mm.
  Seperated by 200 microns
  & there's custom integrated circuit (ASIC) that amplifies the signals & digitizing it
  and has some mechanism for detecting if there were an interesting event detected,
  and then decide to send that through bluetooth to an external device (phone or
  computer) running the Neuralink app.
  Total of (64*16) 1024 electrodes, sampling at just under 20kH with 10 bit each = 200 Mb,
  needs compression & filtering to only send interesting data!
  width of thread starts from 16 micron to 84 micron
  at the end of thread there's a loop the robot can grab to implant it

  each electrode can record between 0 to 40 neurons but practically speaking
  we only see about 2 or 3 at most.

  BOSS algorithm: spike detection algorithm (Buffer online spike sorter)
  it outputs 6 unique values

  flexible electrodes

  There's an external charging device, charging is done through inductive charging but need to be careful not to be too hot
  most of the volume of implant is the (rechargable) battery
  about the size of quarter, 9mm thick
  the hole in the cranium get replaced by this implant

- still ongoing interrogation on the durability/longetivity & reliability of
these micro electrodes

- utah array, array of rigid needles (not flexibles) (1997) only one electrode
on each needle, no active electronics

- how do you build design something like this?
  - material selection (nothing really unique)

- patient registery: people can apply
  then there's a selection
  prescreening interview process
  then go to their homes to do a BCI home audit
- bunch of tests, FMRI, to locate where to put the electrodes
  they try to locate the "hand knob area" in the motor cortex
- surgery 2 to 4 hours
  - anesthesia induction
  - intra-op CT imaging to make sure we are drilling the hole in the right location
  - surgeon comes in, does their thing, skin incision, craniectomy, atherectomy
  - then robot inserts the threads (20 to 40 minutes)
  - surgeon closes this bitch up
- for Noland, one hour after the surgery, they made sure that they were recording
neural signals, and was already able to modulate a couple signals
- preparation: practice the surgery with pretty realistic models based on Noland
  (2:48:22)

- first goal/target of neuralink: telepathy: being able to communicate using
your mind wirelessly with a digital device
gotta train the brain to move a cursor

- some of the threads retracted resulting in a net decrease in the number of
effective electrodes, so they modified the recording algo to be more sensitive
which end up improving the initial results

--------

- DJ Seo, co-founder, president, COO of Neuralink.
- He first start explaining his background:
  - came to the US as a teenager, can't speak english, spent time alone reading
  sci-fi books
  - grandparents with severe form of Alzheimer
  - studied electrical engineering during undergrad
  - research in MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems)
  - PhD program at UC Berkeley
    - Wireless Telecommunication
    - "smart bandaid" in collaboration with Pr Michel Maharbiz
- Michel Maharbiz introduced the idea of ultrasound to build tiny implantable
systems that can be parked next to a neuron being able to record its state and
ping that back to the outside world
- That formed the basis for his thesis called "neural dust"
  - "neural dust": tiny, wireless sensors designed to be implanted in the body to
  monitor and interact with nerves, muscles or organs. Powered & communicate using
  ultrasound.
- explains why electromagnetic waves can't be used
  and why ultrasound works
- backscattering

- Explains the challenges to build tiny neuronal implants the size of neurons
and how ultrasound solved these challenges
- how neurons works and what the electrodes measures
- goes on about the science behind the electrodes



2:50:41

- power of the mind to visualize

- safety: the goal standard is to look at the tissue.
what trauma did you cause to the tissue
they have an entire department (of pathology) that looks at these tissue slices
  euthanize the animal (monkaX human be warned)
  go through necropsy to collect the brain tissue samples
  fix them in formalin
  gross them, section them
  then you look at individual slices
  this is used to evaluate the safety of the insertion mechanism as well as the threads
  FDA supervises this
  the standard for safety is really high, higher than a lot of operations

  they've been impressed by t he lack of immune response from the threads
  no damages detected
  R1 avoids vasculature

  how easy & safe to remove the implant?
  depends on when:
    - first 3 months after the surgery scar tissue is being made
    so it's quiete easy to pull them out, with minimal trauma
    - once the scar tissue forms, it gets harder, the current method:
    cutting the thread, then unscrewing & taking the implant out.
    They think it should be fine to leave the thread "forever"
    once the scar tissue is formed, the threads get anchored in place (don't move)

- they remove the dura to add the threads, but are looking for way to insert
them through the dura (but it's tough & opaque (can't see shit)), letting the
dura would decrease the scar tissue which would make it easier to remove threads
- upgrading
  - for nolan, cut the thread or remove them
  - at the moment: monolithic single implant
    could imagine 2-part implant: bottom the threads, top part for computational heavy loads with battery that you could remove

  Matthew MacDougall (head neurosurgeon at neuralink)

- key metrics to improve:
  - # of channels, current: 1024, end of year: 3k to 6k, next year: 16k
    limitation = photo lithographically print those wires, energy consumption, bandwidth, processing...
    It's always the interface that breaks, bonding this thin film array to the electronics
    how do you protect it, build an hermetic barrier
- how to test that?
  accelerated life tester is a brain in a ALT chamber, it's a vessel with salt water + bunch of stuff to replicate brain environment
  increasing temperature in ALT chamber speed up the aging process
  current version has been there for 2.5year => equivalent to 10 years

- neuralink is in a PCTFE box which has excellent chemical resistance...

- possible to have multiple neuralink implants?
  that's the goal, monkeys have had 2, one in each hemisphere

- blindside (or is it blindsight?), goal is to put implant in visual cortex &
do simulation (more than recording)
  they have been able of stimulating through our thin film array as well as
  other electronics for years (especially for re-activating limbs)
- our understanding of visual system is not very well developed, we know things
about the areas, and how certain zone detect certain shapes, but we don't know
where cognition arise, where color are encoded
- so to bring sight back, we would need an external camera, convert it into
a signal, simulated in the brain, to at least be able to detect edges of objects
- we could think of using more advanced camera to see UV and shit, to go beyond
what human are usually capable to do!

-would you implant a neuralink implant? absolutely, maybe not right now
10, 15, 100 BPS

- primary goals with early patients is to understand the safety of the device &
process. & understand efficacity & impact
early feasability study, learn to improve the device & surgery before embarking
into pivotal study: much larger trial, to look at statistical significance of
our endpoints, that is required before you can market the device

other applications
2 programs:
- movement: digital freedom to control cursor, then try to improve that to the
physical world, to move robotic arms...
speech (requires movement)
- vision

can we get insight into thoughts 

do you see a world with millions of people with neuralink implants?
I do, there are millions of people with neuronal damanges
there's a real possibility to see 8 billion people (everyone) with neuralink

Lex took some drugs in the jungle

    - they have an entire department (department of pathology) to do that
    - no damages/trauma were detected in the brain
    - they've been impressed by the lack of immune response

- removing implant
  - depends if scar tissue has been made (~ 3 month after surgery)
  - before first 3 months, quite easy to pull the thread out with minimal trauma
  - more than 3 months: cut them, remove the implant, evidences show that you
  can live with the thread for the rest of your life. The scar tissue hold them
  in place.

- first goal of neuralink: being able to communicate with a digital device using your mind
  - moving a cursor

- future of neuralink
  - implanting neuralink in visual cursor to help blind people recover sight,
  at least being able to detect edges of objects
  - key metrics to improve
    # of channels, current: 1024, end of year: 3k to 6k, next year: 16k
  - they want to insert the threads through the dura (thick, opaque layer between
  brain & skull) to minimize scar tissue formation
  - discuss about how to upgrade
  - multiple implants: one in each hemisphere
  - movement: digital freedom to control cursor, then improve it to be able to
  interact with real physical world (robotic arms...). Help restore speech,
  - blindsight: goal is to put implant in visual cortex & do simulation
  (today they mostly do recording but they have been able of stimulating for years
  especially for re-activating limbs)
    - lot of work to do
    - would need external camera
    - could beyond visible wavelength
  - early patient: study safety & feasibility, improve device & process
    then pivotal study: much larger trial to look at statistical significance
    then market the device 
  - there's a real possibilith to see 8 billion people (everyone) with a neuralink
  in the future


- when asked if he would get a neuralink implant: "absolutely, maybe not right now,
but absolutely"

- he said the word "kind" like a million times

- oh and, Lex took some drugs in the jungle

// PART 3: Matthew MacDougall

https://youtu.be/Kbk9BiPhm7o?si=Bathz9orrYzJo_Mj&t=13149
from 3:39:09 to 5:06:11

- Matthew MacDougall, the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink
- goes over his background from neuroscience to neurosurgery
  - started studying neuroscience then went to medical school
  - talk about the great surgeons he met
- neurosurgeons work really hard, long hours, relentlessly decades after decades
to reach excellence
- to build a great team you need people able to passionately defend their ideas,
but still able to give up on some, to make the team win

- important stuff
  - animal interest, monkee shit, because they do surgeries on animals!

---- notes

- when you think about it, every success, every failure, every stories boil down
to neurochemistry, so if we get a little bit of control over that, we can provide
the option to do better
- Frans de Waal was a pioneering primatologist who significantly advanced our
understanding of primate behavior, emotions & cognition...
- he studied primate behavior with Frans de Waal, which is similar to human
behaviors
- Lex took some drugs in the jungle btw (3rd time he's saying that)

- college, started look around for labs that could do neuroscience work
originally started the approach looking at interactions between the brain & the
immune system,
he had this idea tha your thought had impact on non-counscious systems of our
body
- wanted to study the brain, studied the brain in neuroimmunology lab in undergrad
- USC for medical school, joint PhD program with Caltech, Chose this program
because of Richard Andersen (researcher on visual physiology, bunch of stuff
including BCI, one of the god father of primate neuroscience)
- neurology is the practice of diagnosing the thing and say "good luck with that"
while neurosurgery has a real impact
- met "epic" neurosurgeons at USC: "Alex Khalessi", "Michael Apuzzo", "Steven L. Gionnotta", "Martin Weiss"
which made them humans, so last minute he switch his speciality to neurosurgery
- the hardest part of residency was to stop working (ok dud)
competitive, big ego,
neurosurgery has long had this aura (NAHH) of mystique & excellence
- (lex fridman) people who knowns him, say that he has the rare quality for a
neurosurgeon of humility
- one of Elon strength is to instantly see through fallacy from authority
- to make a good team at neuralink, try to find people who are not afraid to
defend their ideas, but still able to discuss & end up with the best idea

- lessons learned from neurosurgeons
  - working hard while functioning as a member of a team
  getting a job done that is incredibly difficult
  working hard to make people that you passionately dislike look good
  - relentless in the pursuit of excellence, decades after decades
- share experience about doing your best even tho you know patient is going to
die, and how bad it feels when person is a young parent

- full procedure of N1 implant
  - really simple, straightforward procedure (the human part of the surgery)
  one of the most basic,
  - making a cut in the skin on the top of the head where the representation of
  hand intentions is the most potent. (the hand knob)
  - flap the skin open
  - make a perfectly round 1 inch diameter hole in the skull
  - remove that bit of skull
  - open the lining of the brain
  - show that part of the brain to the robot, and let the robot do its stuff
  - then (human) puts the implant into that hole in the skull, screwing it down
  to the skull, sewing the skin back
  - few hours long, extremely low risk

- human vs robot
  - human are more generalized, and can modify the plan on the go

- lot of practice, everything is tested extremely rigorously
- practice on animals, hundreds of animal surgeries
- for first human, engineers built lifelike models, puslating brain, in a custom
3D printed skull that matches exactly the patient's anatomy (4:14:29)

- surgery on Noland
  - partners at the Barrow Neurologic Institute made everything as easy as possible for the trial
  help on how to arrange the details
  - much more high pressure surgery (not really about safety of the participant)
  but the number of observers, people watching live streams in the hospital
  (anxious about that, about possible unknown unknowns)
  - he was extremely nervous
  - everything went well
  - he placed the robot, he placed the targets on the robot (using a mouse)
    - 4:21:03 lasso tool to select a prime area of brain real estate and it will
    automatically avoid the blood vessels and automatically place a bunch of
    targets that allows the human robot operator to select really good areas of
    the brain

- with neurosurgery you can get anywhere in the brain (it's routine for him to
put deep brain stimulating electrodes near the very bottom of the brain, entering
from the top, using a robot from Globus)
  - take a preoperative MRI
  - put the patient to sleep
  - put their head in a frame
  - take a CT scan of their head
  - merge the MRI & the CT in software
  - you have a plan based on the MRI
  - you get a trajectory to follow
  - the robot arm can show you the trajectory that you intended from the pre-op
  MRI & establish a very rigid holder through which you can drill a small hole
  in the skill & pass a small rigid hollow wire deep into that area of the brain
  & then put your electrode
  - (that's standard technology)
  - it's accepted that there's 1 in 100 patients who have a bleed somewhere in
  the brain (that's not acceptable for Neuralink)
- neuralink is focues entirely on cortical targets, surface targets, because
there are no easy way to put 100s of wire in the brain without damages. You
have much better vision (you can actually see what's happening)

!!!- sewing electrodes into the spinal cord as a potential workaround for a spinal
cord injury that would allow brain-mounted implant to communicate with spine-
mounted implant, to trigger muscular responses.
!!!They have that working in very crude forms in animals
  (doing grasp, moving their legs)


- there's a lot of variability in people brains & skulls,
they had to "disqualify" people with skin or skull too thin or too thick

- hand knob (4:34:04)
- vision is a little deeper in the brain (than the "hand knob"), maybe 1 cm deeper
than hand insertions

- neuralink arose partly after Utah arrays would failed routinely because it
would trigger a bad immune response
Neuralink approach of using tiny flexible elctrodes avoid a lot of the bleeding,
of the immune response, electrode longevity & functionality & the health of the
tissue immediately surrounding the electrode is excellent
(goes on for years now in their animal models)

- the brain controls almost everything, you can control fertility, so there're
a lot of possible applications

- would you have a neuralink chip implanted in your brain? "Yeah"
!!! - value proposition for the average person:
  - new way to interact with digital, faster, more efficient
  - recording speech intentions
    - to remove keyboard
    - speaking (in your mind) to an AI agent, that would answer you in an earphone
      you could silently ask for information and getting it read to you in your ear without anyone knowing
  - feels like we are cavemen, we're barely touching the surface, and will be able
  to do crazy things
  - can we make people able to take care of themselves

- technology on the academic side is progressing at light speed
  - paper out of UC Davis: an accurate and rapidly calibrating speech neuroprosthesis
  BCI able to recognize 125k words (thinking the word, BCI recognizes it)

- he has an RFID chip in his hand with his business card, opens the front door
of his house

- mysticism about putting electronics in our body
  there's still this inviable barrier that the skull represents in people's mind

- how much does neuroplasticity come into play
  - plasticity decreases with age
  - there way to increase it using electrical stimulation (not totally proven out)

- life & death
  - death is inevitable

- conciousness could be the sensation of some part of your brain being active
you feel it working, like you feel the palm of your hand being touched

// PART 4: BLISS CHAPMAN
// brain interface software lead at Neuralink

from 5:06:11 to 6:48:59

- motivation to work at Neuralink:
  - met 100s of people with spinal cord injuries, ALS, and want to help them
- people want (need) independance
  - this is an engineering problem
  with the right resources, right team, we can make a lot of progress

- he was part of the team that interviewed and selected P1 (noland)
  he was in the operating room, monitoring live signals coming out of the brain (see each electrode coming to life)
  he works we the users everyday to develop new UX paradigm's decoding strategies
  part of the team that figured out how to recover useful BCI to new world record levels when the signal quality degraded
- watching the robot was boring
- waited the next morning (after the surgery) to do body mapping,
  when noland was imagining moving his index they could see a spike
  and now they can use that info to move a cursor

- body mapping: way to map out the signals we have access
  - present a visual to the user and say "imagine doing this", the visual is 
  a 3D hand opening and closing, or index finger modulating up & down
  - record the brain activity

- UX is underrated for BCI development in general
  - behavior alignment to neural signal
  - need to find the best things to think about to get the best signals

- what we try to measure: individual neurons producing action potentials which last about 1ms
  sampled at 20kH (so 1 ms -> 20 samples)
- then we can process the signal into "just where do we detect a spike or where do we not"
  so it's converted to a binary signal 1: spike, 0: no spike
- everything we care about for decoding can be represented in the frequency characteristics of spike trains
- so it allows to do a lot of compression, which can be sent via bluetooth

- isolate where the spike comes from?
  - there's a whole academic field about this (to figure out from which neuron a spike comes from)
  - at the current scale the number of neurons per electrode is relatively small, so it's not really a problem

- go over methods they are using or exploring to detect spikes
  - exploring new technique: spike band power: may be able to detect spikes from neurons too far away from the electrode
    (but more expensive, more data)

- latency
  they want to build the best "mouse"
  esport could be dominated by paralysed players with implants
  - you have like 75 ms lead time on any action
  - you have a higher ceiling performance
  - so for games where reaction time is important, you're winning EZ
  "we are already faster than what you would do with muscles"
  - latency currently from brain spike to cursor movement is about 22 ms
  while brain neuron to hand is about 75 ms
  - he said that Noland said feels like he's moving the cursor before he actually
  intended to do it
- current bottlenecks
  - (kind of hilariously) bluetooth low energy protocol has some restriction on
  how fast you can communicate, standard frequency is about 7.5 ms
  which will become too slow
  - how fast screens refresh, 120Hz is not fast enough

- bro keep changing the questions, it's kind of annoying

- about the neuralink app
  - the goal is to help an individual navigate his computer independently
  so need to control mouse & keyboard
  - the job of the app is to translate this wireless stream of brain data coming
  off the implant into control of the computer
  do that by mapping brain activity to sort of the HID inputs to the actual hardware
  (HID (Human Interface Device) is the protocol for communicating, input device events)

- decoding: process of taking statistical patterns of brain data and turning it
into, for example, a mouse movement
  - training step: user imagine doing different actions
  uses a deep neural network

  - best template matching system
    - variety of behavioral challenges & debugging challenges (when woorking with someone who's paralyzed)
    because you can't see what they are doing
  - calibration, you need to make the best UX to make sure user is doing the
  right thing consistently to get the best signals & being able to recognize that
  signal later
  - there's also a ML challenge to find which signal is the best one
  (like when the user has the best behavior)

  => biggest challenge of UX is making sure the user is imagining the right
  behavior and not something slightly different (during calibration)
  -> correct, precise calibration is difficult & an unsolved problem
  -> don't really know about the true user intention
  -> but doesn't need to be solved to get something useful

  => in his view, the core challenge is the labelling problem: how do you
  understand at a very, very fine resolution what the user's attempting to do
  (not solved problem)
  (THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE)
  given a window of time where the user is expressing some behavioral intent,
  what are they really trying to do at the granularity of every millisecond
  (that's a task design problem, a UX problem, ML problem, software problem)

!!! => I think the main idea here is that there's a real challenge to detect
the true intention of the user, and the goal of the UX is to accurately detect
it & convert it to an action (moving cursor, clicking, scrolling...) as fast as
possible. UX gives a lot of controls that the user can tune (speed, smoothness,
friction... of cursor)

- we observe a degradation through time
  can be mitigated by user adapting its strategy
  it can also be mitigated through a combination of software features (like how fast cursor is moving, smoothness, friction)
- recalibrate, there's a system to recalibrate
- when you have a good model calibrated, you can continue using that without
needing to recalibrate it

- UX, you want a control surface that still makes it easy & intuitive for the
user to understand the state of the system & how to achieve what they want
- UX END goal: UX fades into the background completely, that it's subconscious to the user
- UX gives ability to calibrate models on his own, so user can explore what
work best (finding what the best action to imagine give the best signal/easiest
to decode)

let go of trying to control the fingers/hand & control the actual cursor

- how to measure performance, bits per second
  - goal is let users being able to control computers as good as regular people
  or even better/faster
  - (5:57:18) web grid: grid of targets, we compute a score depending on how
  fast & accurate they can select & how small target is
    - different modes
      - left click on the screen
      - or just go over
      - or left + right click
      - ...
      - simplest mode: blue target show up on screen, you left click it
  - BPS is computed by taking the log of the number of targets on the screen
  TIMES (the number of correct selections MINUS incorrect) DIVIDED by time window
  (take the log because of information theory)
  (credit from Dr Krishna Shenoy, neuroscientist)
  (you can subtract 1 to model a keyboard (because one is the delete key))
  LINK TO FORMULA: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7970827/>
    - Noland is the best in the world at this task
      - previous human WR: 4.2 to 4.6 BPS
      - Noland: 8.5 BPS, then 9.51 BPS
    - his own record is like 17 BPS
  - how to improve?
    - Noland good perf is because of his extreme focus & energy, dedicated.
    he can play for like 4 hours (he's grinding GIGACHAD)
    - we don't really know yet, how to improve BPS

- they update the app quite frequently (sometimes 4/5 times a day)
  - noland plays "snake" which is super hard, to tell if a new update is doing
  better or worse

- research sessions: actively tring different things 
  noland can work for like 8h a day, that can be hundereds of different models
- independant use

- 271 pages of notes taken from the BCI sessions in march

- decoder generalization?
  - signals are going to be different between P1 & P2
  ex: channel #123 of P1 will send != signals than channel #123 of P2
  - but the UX should be similar, unless it's overfitted to Noland

- bottlenecks
  - finding good architecture for model to do the neuro mapping
  - software stability & reliability, bunch of bugs degrading perf

6:19:26

- as number of channels increases, logarithmic improvement in control quality
- increasing the number of channel should increase the reliability without
having to modify the decoder itself

- when you imagine stuff, the neurons might fire more or less, the frequency
content of the signal (in the motor cortex) is very correlated with the output
intention (the behavioral task the user is doing).
"rate coding" is the name of that phenomenon
You can imagine that rate coding is like the only way the brain could represent
information (hypothesis). There's evidence in bats for ex, that there's temporal
codes
- so brain may represent information by changing the frequency of a neuron
firing, so what matter is the delta between base line & when signal is modulated.
The base line is different from day to day

- why not just use an eyetracker?
he's confident it's better, because of the ergonomy of how it fits into he life
don't need to be in right position, don't need help to set it up

- building the decoder is really about building the dataset & compiling it into
the weights of the model
  - one of the biggest challenge in designing the optimal model for BCI is that
  offline metrics don't necessarily correspond to online metrics

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PART 5: Noland Arbaugh
// First human with a neuralink implant
// from: 6:49:00 to 8:37:34

- diving accident in 2016 that left him paralized with no feeling from the
shoulders down. Ran into a lake with a bunch of guys, dive in, something happened
(don't know what, maybe received a kick to the left side of his head), and 
that's it, he was paralyzed. [bro wtf, that's crazy, bro broke his neck by doing
the most random shit]
- tried his best to survive & get better. Got a good group of people around him
to support him
- stay positive (is he coping?), watches TV, movies, anime, read
immediate acceptance
faith in god (it was all meant to happened, made his faith stronger)
stress-free guy
extrovert
- wants to try everything possible to make his life better

- should I do this? I could wait until number 2 or 3
but being the first one is pretty cool

- 7:05:51 footage of operation

- trust the people at Neuralink & Barrow with his life
they're the most impressive people in the world

- day of surgery:
  the night before, the morning, he was just excited, "let's make this happen"
  facetiming Elon (something went wrong with his plane)
  wasn't scared

  - at the hospital at 5:30 am
  went through all the pre-op stuff
  prayed
  surgery at 7AM
  woke up, played a bit of a prank on his mom, "who are you?"

- didn't feel any pain, didn't take any pain killer
- after surgery, some neuralink employee brought an ipad, they had put up 8
different channels that were recording some of his neuron spikes
So he started trying to wiggle his fingers, and a yellow spike appeared
(7:12:12)
everyone freaking out, started clapping
he's imagining moving his fingers, it's pretty easy for him to do

- after his accident they told him to keep trying to move his body because
that's going to (could) create new neural pathways or pathways in his spinal
cord to reconnect things to hopefully regain some movement
  - he imagine walking: it's imagining what he had to do to take a step
  which is hard, mentally & physically
  - like the kill bill movie, stare at body parts & say "move", "move your big
  toe"
  - it feels like there's a build up, it feels like there are signals that get
  stuck somewhere, and build up until they burst
  once they burst, he has a really weird sensation of everything dissipating.
  It's like a fatigue, like a muscle fatigue

- for the first few years all he was doing was looking at walls

7:19:05

- what they had him do, especially at the beginning is body mapping.
there's a visualization of a hand or an arm on the screen & he has to do that
motion. That's how they train the algo to understand what he's trying to do
  - he was already doing that, to hopefully get back some of his movements
  but neuralinkg actually gives him some feedback, he can see the signals in
  real-time
  - body mapping is essentially like body training

- was able to move the cursor within the first or second week
didn't seem like big of a deal to him, he expected that to happen

- difference between attempted movement & imagined movement
  - attempted movement: him physically trying to move
  (what he mostly did during the first weeks)
  - imagined movement: think about doing it, not attempting to do it at all,
  visualizing
  - is that supposed to be a different part of the brain that lights up?
  [Bliss Chapman in the background]: not necessarily
  (struggled to do this)
  - feels very different, imagined = mind control, attempted = movement
- realized he could directly move the cursor, just by thinking about moving it,
without attempting to move
- start seeing the spikes before he was actually attempting to move
one day, while playing webgrid, he was just moving his eyes to see the next
target and the cursor started moving toward this direction
=> so one day, he realized he could just imagine, not attempting to move, it
blew its mind, first time he was controlling with his mind (wasn't really
impressed before that)

- about the neuralink app: (visual at 7:36:55)
  - app to help him interact with the computer
  - there are few different settings
  - calibration: how to get cursor control
  5 min to calibrate
  the more time, the better the model gets
  - webgrid into it
  - this is how he connects to the computer in general

  - voice controls to connect to it
  - the charger is also how he connects to the app
  he has to have the implant charger over his head to be able to connect
  cause the implant is in hibernation mode
  - homework tab (todo list)
- him playing snake.io at 7:37:55
  if he can play snake decently well, then it means he has a pretty good model
- he's doing data collection daily
 (he's been slacking on)

- calibration is a bubble game (7:40:10)
  yellow bubble that pop up on the screen
  - at first it's open loop: no control over the cursor, cursor will be moving on its own across the screen
  and he's following it by intention
  - calibration with attempted movement works better than imagined movement
  and it generalizes to imagined movement
  - close loop: when he gets cursor control
  - 7 minutes for calibration
  for good models: 40 or 45 minutes

- webgrid
  - in march 89k targets
  - webgrid is grid that you can make a small or big as you want
  - a cell lights up & you ahve to click it
  - it's a way to benchmark BCI
  - the bigger the grid the more BPS
  - he's doing that on 35x35
  - !!!! vid of him playing at 8:15:50

  - BPS increases if you have multiple type of clicks
  (right (orange), left (blue))

  - right now, he's not clicking with his mind, he uses the dwell cursor, which
  has some latency

- before the threads retracted they were calibrating clicks
  85% of the implant's threads had retracted from his brain's motor cortex after a month
  big oof, he didn't want to lose any capability, he was ready to do another
  surgery, he was very sad
  - couple weeks to go back to previous performance
  they changed the way they measured the behavior of individual neurons
  switched from individual spike detection to spike-band power
  and now it got better

- excited to see the next users, to see what work for them, see if they have
new better ideas
  - hope they work hard, it's not just for us, but everyone that comes after us
  - don't be afraid to go to neuralink or ask him

- people like him just want independance
so neuralink helps do more things without his family around
have the freedom to do things on his own
- when he plays webgrid, he listens to music, and he check the battery left
popup when 10% left

- he plays civilization 6, starts with korea because you can advance tech/science
faster & win

- would like to be able to do clicks
- would like to be able to connect to more devices (now it's just computer)
- would like to be able to control an optimus robot to be more independant

- they played around with "finger spelling"
expect that he could in the future imagine a letter & getting it
