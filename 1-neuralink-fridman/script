// PART 1, Elon musk

- from 0:00:00 to 1:28:13
- Elon's meaning/goal in life:
  - understand the nature of the universe
    or help set up the foundation to get there
  - hopefully AI can help us understand more
  - Neuralink to keep up with AI
  - he's worried about the survival of our civilization,
    about the current declining birth rate,
    he wants to make a self-sustaing city on Mars in case anything goes wrong on Earth!
- About Neuralink
  - Neuralink is a generalized Input/Output device, reading & generating electrical signals
  - Currently 2 humans have a Neuralink implant.
    Hope to do 10 by the end of year (8 more to go)
    The 2nd one has 400 electrodes providing signals
  - Goals:
    - restore basic neurological damages
    - blindsight: enable blind people to see
    - long-term aspiration: improve AI-human symbiosis by increasing bandwidth of communication. Because if AI can produce TB of tokens, when human can only do 1 bit/second.
    It's like talking to a tree!
  - Predictions:
    - believes there's a future with 100s of millions of people with neuralink
    - available for the public in less than 10 years
    - in 1 or 2 years, someone with neuralink could beat a pro-gamer,
      thanks to faster reaction time
    - could upload your memories to never forget anything
- Basic first principle algorithm:
  1. question the requirements, make them less dumb, reduce their number.
     make the question the least wrong as possible
  2. delete the steps where the process stops.
     delete things, even if you need to put them back in after
  3. optimize it, simplify the process
  => mistake of smart engineers = optimize things that should not exist
- Lex Friedman took some drugs
  (it's Fridman, but he got fried, you get it) 
- Elon is building a data/compute cluster to train AI in Memphis
  - 100k GPUs, crazy amount of cables
  - like one big brain
  - not ready yet, but finally got some AI training going
  - power fluctuation issues
- About Optimus robots
  - Elon is confident there will be billions of robots in the future
  - still struggle to have it to walk in the park
  - can already pick up objects
  - hand: close to half of all the engineering effort
  - still a lot of work to do
- About xAI / grok
  - grok 3 should be available at the end of the year (if they are lucky),
    hopefully better than the state of the art
  - data
    - humans have accumulated just a little bit of data about the reality
      when training an AI, we quickly run out of data.
    - internet is polluted with a lot of AI content
    - Tesla provides a lot of real-time video data (from several million of cars)
    - Optimus robots should be able to provide a lot of data in the future
      (could be the biggest source of data)
    - grok (xAI) has the advantage of having immediate access to twitter data,
      while other companies need to scrap it
  - AI safety concerns:
    - if you train AI to lie, you're really asking for trouble,
    - if you enforce rules, they could backfire
    - Elon wants to train AI to be as truthful as possible
      for grok, they use AI to check if it's most likely correct or not before using the data
- About Trump endorsment
  - Elon implies he doesn't agree with everything DT said/done
  - Trump displayed courage under fire, you can't fake bravery
    while Biden struggled to walk
  - So, at the time, Biden vs Trump was an easy choice
  - we don't have a secure border,
    we want clean & safe city,
    we need to reduce/slow down spending, which is currently bankrupting the country
  - He discussed with Trump, the idea of a government efficiency commission,
    he would be willing to be part of,
    to remove/delete the inefficient things,
    "attacking the matrix" but "the matrix will fight back"
- About civilization
  - civilization is pretty recent, 5.5k years old, starting with the sumerians
  - empires rise and fall
  - civilization goes in cycles, no civilization is forever
  - after a certain level of prosperity,
    birth rate drops,
    and civilization disappear
    (source: "The lessons of History" by Will & Ariel Durant)
    this is happening right now
  - SpaceX goal is to establish a self-sustaining city on Mars,
    as a back up plan for our civilization

// PART 2, DJ Seo

- from 1:28:14 to 3:39:09
- Lex Fridman interviews DJ Seo, the co-founder, president & COO of Neuralink.
- DJ Seo starts by explaining his background.
  [PAUSE TO READ]
  - came to the US as a teenager, couldn't speak english, spent time alone reading
  sci-fi books
  - grandparents with severe form of Alzheimer
  - studied electrical engineering during undergrad
  - research in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)
  - PhD program at UC Berkeley
    - Wireless Telecommunication
    - "smart bandaid" in collaboration with Pr Michel Maharbiz
  - Pr Michel Maharbiz is known for remotely controlling beetles with brain implants

- Michel Maharbiz introduced the idea of using ultrasound to build tiny implantable
systems that can be parked next to a neuron being able to record its state and
ping that back to the outside world
- That formed the basis for DJ Seo's thesis called "neural dust"
  - "neural dust": tiny, wireless sensors designed to be implanted in the body to
  monitor and interact with nerves, muscles or organs. Powered & communicate using
  ultrasound.

- Explains the challenges to build tiny neuronal implants the size of neurons
and why electromagnetic waves can't be used but ultrasound can

- talk about the sciences & engineering behind neuralink implants
  - how neurons works and what the electrodes measures
  - types of physics involved
  - the brain is mostly salt water at 37Â°C, harsh environment for any electronics to survive
  - use backscattering to get the data back
  - materials

- history of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI)
  [PAUSE TO READ]
  - 1790s: concept of animal electricity discovered by Luigi Galvani
    connected set of electrodes to frog leg
  - 1920s, Hans Berger discovered EEG & electroencephalography
  - 1940s, Renshaw, Forbes, Morrison inserted glass micro electrodes into the
  cortex and recorded single neurons.
  - 1950s, Hodgkin & Huxley build the model of biological neurons that describes
  the action potentials of a neuronal biological membrane
  - 1969, Eb Fetz (Univ of Washington) published paper "Operating Conditioning
  of Cortical Unit Activity", he was able to record a single unit neuron from a
  monkey & was able to have the monkey modulated based on its activity & reward system
  - 1980s paper by Apostolos Georgopoulos, discovered "motor directional tuning curve",
  single neurons in the motor cortex exhibit maximal activity for a particular
  "preferred" movement direction.
  - utah array, array of rigid needles (not flexibles) (1997) only one electrode on each needle, no active electronics

- describes the 3 major components of neuralink:
  (image at 2:16:47 https://youtu.be/Kbk9BiPhm7o?si=aPd3-q23Z47Oo4k8&t=8207)
  - N1 implant or "the link": the device that records the neurons
  - R1, surgical robot that implants the tiny wires (threads)
  - B1 app: software to decode the signals, running very simple ML model that
  enable the first user Noland to move a cursor

- About the "Link":
  - implant has 64 flexible threads, each has 16 electrodes along the span of 3 or 4 mm.
  Width of thread starts from 16 micron to 84 micron
  For a total of 1024 electrodes, sampling at just under 20kH with 10 bit each = 200 Mb,
  At the end of thread there's a loop the robot can grab to implant it.
  They're inserted into the cortical layer (3 to 5 mm in the human brain) in the motor cortex region (by the robot)
  - there's a custom integrated circuit (ASIC) that amplifies the signals & digitizing it
  and has some mechanism for detecting if there were an interesting event detected,
  and then decide to send that through bluetooth to an external device (phone or
  computer) running the Neuralink app.
  - each electrode can record between 0 to 40 neurons but practically speaking
  they only see 2 or 3 at most.
  - There's an external charging device, charging is done through induction.
  - Most of the voume of the implant is the battery
  - about the size of quarter, 9 mm thick
  - still ongoing interrogation on the durability/longetivity & reliability of
  these micro electrodes

- talked about the entire process of the first man who received a Neural link:
  - first human patient in january 2024: Noland Arbaugh
  - there's a patient registery, where people can apply
    then there's a selection then a prescreening interview process
    then they go to their homes to do a BCI home audit
  - bunch of tests, FMRI, to locate where to put the electrodes
  - preparation: practice the surgery with pretty realistic models based on Noland
    (2:48:22)
  - surgery 2 to 4 hours
    - anesthesia induction
    - intra-op CT imaging to make sure we are drilling the hole in the right location
    - surgeon comes in, does their thing, skin incision, craniectomy, atherectomy
    - then robot inserts the threads one by one (20 to 40 minutes)
    - surgeon closes this bitch up
  - for Noland, one hour after the surgery, they made sure that they were recording
  neural signals, and was already able to modulate a couple signals
  - some of the threads retracted resulting in a net decrease in the number of
effective electrodes, so they modified the recording algo to be more sensitive
which end up improving the initial results

- about safety:
  - really high standard for safety, higher than a lot of operations
  - supervised by FDA
  - robots avoids vasculature
  - they looked at slices of tissues (from animal experimentation):
    - they have an entire department (department of pathology) to do that
    - no damages/trauma were detected in the brain
    - they've been impressed by the lack of immune response

- removing implant
  - depends if scar tissue has been made (~ 3 month after surgery)
  - before first 3 months, quite easy to pull the thread out with minimal trauma
  - more than 3 months: cut them, remove the implant, evidences show that you
  can live with the thread for the rest of your life. The scar tissue hold them
  in place.

- first goal of neuralink: being able to communicate with a digital device using your mind
  - moving a cursor

- how to test that?
  accelerated life tester is a brain in a ALT chamber, it's a vessel with salt water + bunch of stuff to replicate brain environment
  increasing temperature in ALT chamber speed up the aging process
  current version has been there for 2.5year => equivalent to 10 years

- future of neuralink
  - implanting neuralink in visual cursor to help blind people recover sight,
  at least being able to detect edges of objects
  - key metrics to improve
    # of channels, current: 1024, end of year: 3k to 6k, next year: 16k
  - they want to insert the threads through the dura (thick, opaque layer between
  brain & skull) to minimize scar tissue formation
  - discuss about how to upgrade
  - multiple implants: one in each hemisphere
  - movement: digital freedom to control cursor, then improve it to be able to
  interact with real physical world (robotic arms...). Help restore speech,
  - blindsight: goal is to put implant in visual cortex & do simulation
  (today they mostly do recording but they have been able of stimulating for years
  especially for re-activating limbs)
    - lot of work to do
    - would need external camera
    - could beyond visible wavelength
  - early patient: study safety & feasibility, improve device & process
    then pivotal study: much larger trial to look at statistical significance
    then market the device 
  - there's a real possibilith to see 8 billion people (everyone) with a neuralink
  in the future


- when asked if he would get a neuralink implant: "absolutely, maybe not right now,
but absolutely"

- he said the word "kind" like a million times

- oh and, Lex took some drugs in the jungle

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PART 3, Matthew MacDougall

- from 3:39:09 to 5:06:11
- Matthew MacDougall is the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink
- talked about his background from neuroscience to neurosurgery
  [PAUSE TO READ]
  - studied primate behavior with Frans de Waal (pioneering primatologist)
  - started studying neuroscience then went to medical school,
    went to USC, joint PhD program with CalTech
  - talked about the great surgeons he met
  - what it takes to be a neurosurgeon,
    work really hard, long hours, relentlessly,
    decades after decades to reach excellence
  - shared his experience of losing patients

- About the full procedure of the N1 implant:
  - really simple, straightforward procedure,
    one of the most basic operation
  - making a cut in the skin on the top of the head
    where the representation of hand intentions is the most potent
!   (the hand knob) (4:34:04)
  - flap the skin open
  - make a perfectly round 1 inch diameter hole in the skull
  - remove that bit of skull
  - open the lining of the brain (the layers between skull & brain)
  - show that part of the brain to the robot
  - select the targets for the robot
!   - 4:21:03 lasso tool to select a prime area of brain real estate and it will
    automatically avoid the blood vessels and automatically place a bunch of
    targets that allows the human robot operator to select really good areas of
    the brain
  - and let the robot do its stuff
  - then (human) puts the implant into that hole in the skull,
    screwing it down to the skull,
    sewing the skin back
  - few hours long, extremely low risk

- About the surgery on the first human
  - partners at the Barrow Neurologic Institute
    made everything as easy as possible for the trial
  - he was extremely nervous (not about the safety)
    because a lot of people were watching,
    and anxious about possible unknown unknowns
  - everything went well
  - he placed the robot and the targets on the robot (using a mouse)

- lot of practice, everything is tested extremely rigorously
  lot of practice on animals, hundreds of animal surgeries
- for first human, engineers built lifelike models,
  with a puslating brain, in a custom 3D printed skull
! that matches exactly the patient's anatomy (4:14:29)

- there's a lot of variability in people brains & skulls,
they had to "disqualify" people with skin or skull too thin or too thick

- neuralink focuses entirely on surface targets,
because there are no easy way to put 100s of wires deep in the brain without damages.
So they stay at the surface level, you have much better vision
- with neurosurgery you can get anywhere in the brain.
  - it's routine for him to put deep brain stimulating electrodes
    near the very bottom of the brain
  - but you have little visibility,
    requires preoperative MRI merge with CT scan by specialized software
  - usually performed with the help of a robotic arm
  - it's accepted that there's 1 in 100 patients who have a bleed
    somewhere in the brain (that's not acceptable for Neuralink)

- vision is a little deeper in the brain than the "hand knob", maybe 1 cm deeper

- neuralink arose partly after Utah arrays would failed routinely
  because it would trigger a bad immune response
  - Neuralink approach of using tiny flexible electrodes
    avoids a lot of the bleeding,
    avoids a big immune response,
    increase electrode longevity (still doing good after years in animals)
  - the health of the tissue immediately surrounding the electrode is excellent


- in the future, they could sew electrodes into the spinal cord
  as a potential workaround for a spinal cord injury.
  That would allow brain-mounted implant to communicate with spine-mounted implant,
  to trigger muscular responses.
  - They have that working, in very crude forms, in animals
    (doing grasp, moving their legs)


- Q: "Would you have a neuralink chip implanted in your brain?"
  A: "Yeah"
- he already has an RFID chip in his hand containing his business card,
  and it can open the front door of his house

- The value proposition of Neuralink for the average person:
  - new way to interact with digital devices, faster, more efficiently
  - recording speech intentions
    - to remove keyboard
    - speaking (in your mind) to an AI agent, that would answer you in an earphone.
      You could silently ask for information
      and getting it read to you in your ear without anyone knowing.
  - can we make people able to take care of themselves

- It feels like we are cavemen,
  we're barely touching the surface, and will be able to do crazy things

- technology on the academic side is progressing at light speed
  - paper out of UC Davis: "an accurate and rapidly calibrating speech neuroprosthesis"
    a BCI was able to recognize 125k words (thinking the word, BCI recognizes it)

- conciousness could be the sensation of some part of your brain being active
you feel it working, like you feel the palm of your hand being touched

- Lex took some drugs in the jungle btw (3rd time he's saying that)


// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PART 4, Bliss Chapman

- from 5:06:11 to 6:48:59
- Bliss Chapman is the "brain interface software lead" at Neuralink
- listed his Neuralink resume
  [PAUSE to read]
  he was part of the team that interviewed and selected P1 (noland)
  he was in the operating room, monitoring live signals coming out of the brain 
  he works with the users everyday to develop new UX paradigm's decoding strategies
  he's part of the team that figured out how to recover useful BCI to new world record levels when the signal quality degraded
- his motivation to work at Neuralink is to help paralyzed people gain independence
- he mainly focuses on the User Experience (UX)
- his goal is to create the "best mouse",
  he believes esport could be dominated by paralysed players with implants.
  - you have like 75ms lead time on any action
  - the latency currently from brain spike to cursor movement is about 22 ms
    while brain spike to hand movement is about 75 ms
- there's a real challenge to detect the true intention of the user
  the goal of the UX is to accurately detect it
  & convert it to an action (moving cursor, clicking, scrolling...)


// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PART 5, Noland Arbaugh

- from: 6:49:00 to 8:37:34
- Noland Arbaugh is the first human with a Neuralink Implant
- Could have waited to be number 2 or 3, but being first is pretty cool
- In 2016
  Noland got paralyzed from the shoulders down
  after diving in a lake and receiving a hit to the left side of his head
- Noland is a very positive, stress-free, extroverted individual
  with a good group of people around him to support him
- Noland has a strong faith in God,
  this accident made his faith stronger
- since the accident, he wants to try everything possible to make his life better
- doctors told him to keep trying to move his body because it can create new
  neural pathway to reconnect things & regain some movements
  (body training)
  - this is hard both mentally & physically
! - (add kill bill ref) it's like the kill bill movie
    <https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEVySUhk5sXOQ/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1631796474764?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=JmS91azXPbMSaHuXPkKgBiFTupzM1S92bi08L0mWgpU>
  - it feels like there's a build up
    it feels like there are signals that get stuck somewhere
    and build up until they burst
    once they burst, he has a really weird sensation of everything dissipating.
- About the surgery:
! 7:05:51 footage of operation
  - He trusts the people at Neuralink & Barrow with his life
  - The morning of the surgery, he was just excited, he wasn't scared
  - facetimed Elon Musk
  - at the hospital at 5:30 AM
    went through all the pre-op stuff
  - prayed
  - surgery at 7 AM
  - woke up and played a bit of a prank on his mom by asking her "who are you?"
  - didn't feel any pain
  - after surgery, some neuralink employees brought an ipad, they had put up 8
    different channels that were recording some of his neuron spikes
    So he started trying to wiggle his fingers, and a yellow spike appeared
!    (7:12:12)
- At the beginning is was doing a lot of "body mapping":
  there's a visualization of a hand or an arm on the screen
  and he has to attempt to do that motion
  this is how the algorithm is trained to understand what he's trying to do
- body mapping is pretty much what he was already doing to try to recover some
movement, but Neuralink gives him some feedback, he can see the signals in real
time
- body mapping is essentially like body training
- he was able to move the cursor within the first or second week
- attempted vs imagined movement
  - attempted = physically trying to move
  - imagined = thinking about moving
  - he thinks attempted movement is easier & more natural
    and was moving the cursor like this
  - but one day he realized he could imagine moving the cursor.
    For the first time, he was mind controlling the cursor,
    and was really impressed that he could do that!
- After about a month,
  - 85% of the implant's threads had retracted from his brain's motor cortex.
  - before the threads retracted they were calibrating clicks,
    now is unable to click with his mind, he uses a dwell cursor
  - was very sad about that
  - after a couple weeks,
    they changed the way they measured the behavior of individual neurons
    switched from individual spike detection to spike-band power
    and now it got better
- About the Neuralink App:
! (visual at 7:36:55)
  - it's an app to help him interact with the computer
  - this is how he connects to the computer in general
  - there are few different settings
  - he has a homework tab (todo list)
  - webgrid is integrated to it
  - he has to have the implant charger over his head to be able to connect
    cause the implant is in hibernation mode
  - this is where he does calibration = how to get cursor control
- About Calibration
  - training phase to learn to control the cursor
! - calibration is a bubble game (7:40:10)
  - at first it's open loop:
    no control over the cursor
    cursor is moving on its own across the screen
    and he's following it by intention
  - calibration with attempted movement works better than imagined movement
    and it generalizes to imagined movement
  - close loop: when he's the one controlling the cursor (visual feedback)
  - calibration can list a minimum of 7 minutes
    but for better results, it takes 40 to 45 minutes
- he's doing data collection daily

- About WebGrid
!  - !!!! vid of him playing at 8:15:50
  - webgrid is grid that you can make a small or big as you want
  - a cell lights up & you have to click it
  - it's a way to benchmark BCI
    - the bigger the grid the more BPS
    - BPS increases if you have multiple type of clicks
      (right (orange), left (blue))
  - he's doing that on 35x35
  - he's addicted & grinding it
- Neuralink helps him do more things independently
  he can play games (snake.io, civilization 6), read, listen to music
! him playing snake.io at 7:37:55
- He's excited to see the next Neuralink users, to see what work for them, see
  if they have new ideas to make things better!
- In the future, he would like to be able to
  - do clicks
  - connect to more devices (now, it's just computers)
  - control an optimus robot to be more independent
- they played around with "finger spelling" to write some text
